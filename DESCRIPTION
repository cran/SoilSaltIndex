Description: The developed function generates soil salinity indices using satellite data, utilizing multiple spectral bands such as Blue, Green, Red, Near-Infrared (NIR),
             and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR1, SWIR2). It computes 24 different salinity indices crucial for monitoring and analyzing salt-affected soils efficiently.
             For more details see, Rani, et al. (2022). <DOI: 10.1007/s12517-022-09682-3>. One of the key features of the developed function is its flexibility.
             Users can provide any combination of the required spectral bands, and the function will automatically calculate only the relevant indices based on the available data.
             This dynamic capability ensures that users can maximize the utility of their data without the need for all spectral bands, making the package versatile and user-friendly.
             Outputs are provided as GeoTIFF file format, facilitating easy integration with GIS workflows.
